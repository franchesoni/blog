after thinking about taxes for a while I've got a few conclusions. The first thing is the nature of the taxes. Taxes are used to fund the state which is putting money into things that are common. Sometimes these things don't benefit all of the population direcly but only a few, but it's usually expected for the investment to have further reach. Then we have other services that are collaborative other than the state. In fact we could think of the state as a collection of collaborative services amongh which we can find infrastructure investments, energy investments, security, public health, wealth redistribution, public education and so on. All of these things are important for a society and the state can be seen as the company providing all of these services. The nature of the state is then collaborative, as is the nature of insurance companies. Furthermore, the state isn't only a colelction of collaborative projects but also the collaborative construction of regulations and enforcement that hopefully guarantee a better outcome for the whole. The state is an organization the people of a country have created to help them be happier. 

The state as such collaborative endevour rapidly degenerates into the state as a parent. The state that tells you what to do and how to live. This is because once one accepts that imposing values or codes of conduct is good for the overall society is very easy to overdoit. The question should be something like "what are the things that benefit us all?"

Because dividing the state into the multiple roles it fulfills would be a nightmare (imagine people having to pay the police tax, the road tax, the public illumination tax, the cleaning tax, the health tax... it makes sense to centralize all of that into this powerful organization. This organization should be funded.

The state lives in an economy where people have and value private property and work producing things that are presumably valuable. The productive capacity usually corresponds to some money (but not always) and the purest capitalism has shown to be unable to properly distribute that money in a way that provides dignity to people. One of the values I will push forward is the idea of the state as the corrector of the raw economy, understood as private property and free trade. The state does that to preserve the wellness of the people as a whole, e.g. making private monopolies illegal or giving money to people that are hungry. 

I don't want to let the psychological dimension unmentioned. The happiness of the people doesn't only depend on the material dimension, we need to eat but also to feel good. Culture is very important for society because social norms are related to empathy. 

Coming back to the economy, the first role of the state is to correct the uneven distribution of the money. A good society shouldn't accept the existence of hungry children or the lack of access to proper sanitary conditions. One way the state does this is by taking part of the productive output of society and spending it as it pleases. There are three main types of taxes, added value tax (TVA in france and IVA in uruguay), property tax (or fortune tax) and income tax. People usually discuss the income tax but I don't know how important it is. 

The added value tax is a tax to consumption that makes things more expensive. In the end the consumer is paying the tax and if not the company would have to pay it. Either way, taxes to companies and TVA are similar. They raise the price of products. This could be a nice way to incentivize consumption on some things over others. For instance, fruits and vegetables might not need a high taxation because they make people healthier but sugar might need it because it might cause diabetes. This is what many states are already doing but differentiating taxes on products such as cigarretes. This action should be standardized. Society may define how to evaluate a product and all products might be scored and the tax on each product set accordingly. Products would be scored from 1 to 100 and the tax computed in place. Most places have electronic payment so this makes sense. How much to tax consumption is a decision that should be made by maximizing an estimate of happiness in the population. I've got no idea, but in uruguay it's 22%. 

The second tax is the income tax that should be higher for people that earn more and should be negative for people that earn less. However, we need to take care of a few things, for instance, a person can't earn less if they work more. Another thing is that people shouldn't be taxed a lot if they happen to have a good year. The first problem is easily solved by ensuring that the income always grows whatever the tax rate is. In other words, if one person A has more income that person B then they should continue to have more income when taxed, in other words x_A - f(x_A)x_A > x_B - f(x_B)x_B if x_A > x_B. This means that x_A / x_B > (1 - f(x_B)) / (1 - f(x_A)) or if we call r_P the percentage that is kept by person P then we have that x_A / x_B > r_B / r_A > 1 because we want r_B to keep more than r_A (as they earn less) but the keep rate can't grow faster than the decrease rate in salary. In other words, if the previous salary was some p% more that the new salary then the keep rate can't grow more than p. When taking infinitesimal steps we have that the keep rate r satisfies

x / (x - eps) > r(x - eps) / r(x)  

taking logs
 
log x - log (x - eps) > log r(x - eps)  - log r(x)

changing variables x' = x-eps

log (x + eps) - log (x)  > log r(x) - log r(x + eps)

x (-1)

- log (x + eps) + log (x)  <  log r(x + eps)- log r(x) 

and now call k(x) = log(r(e^x)) and let log(x) = x'

-(x'+eps*(1/x')+O) + x' < k(x'+eps)
