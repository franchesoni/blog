## Stuff

### Minimalism

Although I call myself a minimalist sometimes, I have more things than those in my two black bags. The two black bags are the very basics, the stuff I can live with, but that doesn't mean I can't have more stuff. However, thinking about having more is exhausting, so I'll keep everything limited.

The expansion will include a few goods I think are awesome: a mixer or soup maker, winter clothing and a pair of winter shoes, a bike (and potentially the bike shoes), dumbells and a pullup bar.

### Buying stuff

If I see something that is cheap, has multiple uses, I really like and that can replace something in my current wardrobe, then I can go buy it.

### On style

Dressing well is important. One could go a little too much like Emily, or be more discrete. I value discretion. However, that doesn't mean that I can not dress sexy. I should wear clothes that suit me well. This is to say, proper, stylish clothing. As I have just a few things, it is easy to set the bar high: new stuff should be better than the stuff to be replaced.

## Health and wellbeing

### Physical health

I am young, so I shouldn't be that expensive. However, there are a few things I don't skip: regular checkups (dental, blood, STDs), exercising and sleeping well. Checkups will have to be every year or every 6 months if I find an issue.

### Nutrition

Blood checkups will inform my nutritional needs. I am a flexible vegetarian who is not against complements. Moreover, I try to stick to a 8-hour eating window, e.g. 10-18hs. It is also good to avoid sugar spikes and preferring raw food, in particular vegetables. Otherwise my nutritional habits are quite ok, I usually eat "healthy".

Food can be bought or cooked by me. I'll have to learn to make a few dishes and to freeze stuff. Good ability to have, isn't it?

### Exercise and meditation

I exercise roughly every morning with home equipment. Something short but useful to build long-term strength. I also do Yoga a few times a week because it is good to meet people, I am really stiff and it is good to relax in the night before going to sleep. I also meditate a few times a week and use the bike when possible. When working, try to use a standing desk.

### Sleep

To take care of my sleep I try to wake up roughly everyday at the same time. Ideally, there are 9 hours allocated to sleep, with a minimum of 7hs per night. If possible, soundproof, lightproof, and a moderately cold room are preferable. Sleeping face up is something I could try to develop.



## Social

### Preservation

There are bonds I would like to preserve. Maybe with a "happy birthday". Or more often video-calling my grandma(s). It is difficult to keep up with everyone though. LinkedIn and Instagram as social networks in which I have a profile help me with this in a relatively passive way. Sending, once in a while, a message to people is not a bad idea.  

### Pickup

As dating apps like Tinder do not work that well for me I should continue exploring cold approaches. They sometimes work as a way to meet new people and with enough of them I can be satisfied in terms of interaction. However, I should develop my own journey without consuming content that I already know. The principles are awareness and tension/relaxation, feeling good with myself (because I am beautiful and great), and opening up to create connection, coming from shared reactions to the same experience.  

### Social health

Socializing seems to be very relevant for longevity (according to a TED talk). At the same time, the feeling of loneliness is related to how many people are consistently part of our day-to-day life, e.g. people that live or work with us. Of course, it is important to actively listen and develop more and more empathy.

## Work

### Why

Creating value is of paramount importance. Working is a meaningful activity that gives me the opportunity to create meaningful relationships and to contribute to the world. At the same time, I can also contribute with the money I earn (more on this later).



### Activities

#### Research

I have a job as a researcher. This job is something I do part-time but in which I am highly efficient, as my output has to be as if I were full time.

I know how to do some of the stuff, but I should keep the bar high in terms of learning and productivity. The main task of a researcher is to have good ideas. It is like being an entrepreneur of ideas. And this can (hopefully) be learned. The other main task (as an engineer) is to actually build the research into useful products. I should learn to do both. For the world and for my future. 

#### Entrepreneurship

I would also like to build organizations that have some positive impact. This is why I have side projects. I devote time to them because some of them are, potentially, the most important stuff I can do. Between these projects I have an investment fund, i.e. I manage a portfolio and I have a company that produces solar forecasts. I should do this first in the day.


## Finance

### Budget

My income has four main places to go: survival, *plaisir*, investments and donations. Donations make a 10%. Survival and *plaisir* are limited (e.g. 800 per month). The rest is going to investments.

### Financial Investments

These are things like the US financial markets, Numerai, peer2peer lending, etc. This is managed by myself and my "investment fund". 

### Investment in "myself"

This is investment in education or in companies that I create. Accountability and money put by myself help to transmit confidence and to lock in any profit.


### Donations

Effective Altruism or things like that go here. In particular *Give Directly* and *deworm the world initiative* are good places where to put money in. Maybe some other help, to people that I know, could be an option.

## Planning

### Platforms
I use Google tasks to set day-ahead tasks and potential tasks. I use Google keep to write down ideas. I use my laptop (synced with Mega) to write stuff like this and work. 

### Journal

I also keep a journal in which I do quarter planning (3 months), week planning, day planning. This allows me to pursue long-term projects. In the same journal I write a day review each night. Free time is scheduled!

## Publicity

The advantages of scale can not be underestimated. This means using platforms like YouTube or Medium to push information out that can be consumed by many. Instagram, Twitter or LinkedIn are similar in the sense that the content could be publicly available, but it requires time to build a network of followers if you don't have that already.

Then, it is useful to use these platforms to share stuff. Something I have not really decided is if I should do it in personal title or not. Maybe sharing under a pseudonym is better. Reputation is hard to earn and easy to lose. 

What is important though is to share things when possible, because things are useless if not shared.

## Hobbies

Reading, podcasts, running, sports, sex, music, museums, writing, friends.

### Distractions

TV shows, videogame streams, instagram, whatsapp (in short, virtuality).

## Good practices

High focus and slow-motion multitasking. 90-min chunks. Active rest. Good planning. Value time. Be present. Enjoy life. Remember to be always be a good man.
