# Life lessons

- Think deeply about and understand deeply the problems of your students. Think about the implications. 
I learned this in the hard way: the first big research project I supervised had me committing two big mistakes. First, I thought that SSIM was a good metric that accounted for perceptual similarity. This is true, but not in the case of prediction. In the context of image prediction there are both the image content prediction and the image texture prediction. SSIM mixes both and this makes it a terrible metric to evaluate prediction or texture.
The second mistake was that I did not think about how to use a GAN to make predictions. I forgot to mention that if the discriminator was not conditioned on the input, then it would only learn to differentiate predictions from images in the database, instead of predictions from predictions in the database. My bad.

- Try stuff
Many times the ideas in your mind seem capable to be developed until perfection. This is most of the times false (except in pure maths). You need to go to put ideas in the real world, try them out, have feedback and experience them.
I learned this both by listening to people from Y combinator or from the lessons in the Lean Startup, and by developing stuff. I spent a lot of time designing in my mind a perfect organizing method. And I should say that I got pretty close. But only with the experience of actually using this "bujo" tool I could perfect it to my needs. 

- Expose yourself
Sometimes you don't think you are able to do something you are tasked with. This is sometimes known as impostor syndrome. I learned that many times what makes you "good enough" to tackle an activity is simply stepping up to do the activity. I learned this in Chile, with a professor that was kind but far from excellent. He got a very big contract with the government. I did not understand how the government could give that much money (400k usd) to not excellent people. I reasoned this was possible not because he was good, but because he made someone else think he was good. The logic follows the Turing test, if you can fake it, you are enough. In the same line, I stepped up and ending up presenting a paper that was not mine on an international symposium. I did not even have the basics of telecommunications and I was talking about it. Great experience. 

- Take care of your reputation
As Buffet said, reputation is your most valuable asset. I think this lesson is one I would like to integrate before learning it from experience. It relates to the tale of the "pastor mentiroso".

- Exceed expectations
What was written as "overdeliver" in the book "never split the difference" is a particular case of the fact that people (and financial markets) react to facts according to how well these facts align to their expectations. If the facts exceed their expectations, they are happy and excited. If not, they are frustrated and disappointed. To generate happy feelings we should go over the expectations. Nasty easy trick: you can first lower the expectations by talking. If you paint hte image of the tiniest and shittiest apartment ever, and then they enter your small apartment, you have exceeded expectations.

- Depth _and_ breadth
This is something my supervisor at Huawei Joseph Meehan told me when I asked for feedback. Being excellent is about depth and breadth of knowledge, you have the breadth, you lack the depth. But be careful, go for depth without sacrificing breadth. 

- Be very careful about what you put in your mind
Our mind is like a sponge, it will absorb whatever it is in contact with. This includes but is not restricted to experiences, movies, books, articles, books, poems, habits, people, norms. The things you are in contact with and integrate will shape your future self, just as food influences your body, but presumably more permanently. Be careful and conscious about this.

- Being mature or wise is not just being experienced, but remembering the lessons from experience.
I learned when I dated an amazing woman, very mature, but also younger (21 vs 24), that being mature is not only about experiences. She was surprisingly mature and emphatic, while not having had the quantity and diversity of experiences I had had. I wondered why, because I thought of myself as someone that could learn from his experiences. The answer is memory. Being mature or wise is not just about having experiences, one has to be open-minded, curious and observant enough to learn something from them. But not only that, one has to also have enough memory to remember these learned lessons. This is one reason behind me writing this.

- Lessons can come from others' experiences too
As a teenager, I would mansplain the ladies I dated, which was impressive at the time. I did that by recalling not only my experiences but also taking knowledge out of the pool of experiences of my friends. This required me to listen actively and really apprehend from their stories. This is harder than learning from our own experiences, but is very useful and also explains why this young woman I loved (from the previous paragraph) was so mature: she had great memory, really listened to her friend's stories and also read books and watched movies, that also have an awful lot of messages to be given.

- Be empathetic
This comes from many self-development / seduction / negotiation books: people love to be heard. Not only that, but we can learn from that, and active listening is a way to be present and show our love. It is also a very human quality and its the quintessential piece of emotional intelligence. The world we live in is very human: being empathetic is not only useful but also enjoyable. 

- Empathy comes from culture
At some point I was worried I was not very emphatic. It was hard for me to act as if I cared when I didn't, and many times, I didn't. Spoiler, I don't think empathy is (at least in me) very natural, but I think it more like a collection of habits around human relationships. These relationships are framed on some culture. When I looked for ways to increase my empathy I found as suggestions watching movies / reading books. In other words, the suggestion was to expose myself to human feelings framed into some world. Culture has a huge impact on how we feel and behave, this is way being culturally savvy is equivalent, to some extent, to developing empathy.

- Integrate low-frequency/long-term/stable/fundamental information
Integrate information that will be valid in the future. You don't have time to integrate all information relevant for the present moment at the present moment. The best you can do is to learn continuously and ensure that the things you learn remain valid in the future. In some sense, accumulate a non-depreciating knowledge currency. Lessons that are valid through time are, in this sense, like gold. This also suggests that we should ignore most low frequency (news / social media) information. There are great reviews of low frequency info that will be provided (ML-news, tiranos temblad, etc.).

- Manipulate yourself
We are like machines. Although we think we have free-will, it is not so much the case, and when we have it, we may lack willpower. It is easier to think about us as a river that is unstoppable but we can slightly deviate by placing some constraints on the border. In the same way, our exercise, social interactions, food, drinks, sleep, sun, and a long etc. are the borders that influence what we feel and how we behave. It is wise to manipulate it.

- We are tremendously flexible
Don't be too harsh on your routines though. The body is really flexible and resistant. It can go through chemotherapy. It can stand many days without food. Time can make us recover from most of the hardships we experience. It does not matter that much if you eat that piece of dessert or not. Of course, this has limits. But we perfectionists usually err on the safe side. Learned this from Lex Fridman.
