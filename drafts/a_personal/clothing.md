# Dressing

This is for me, which means clothing for :

- thin men
- minimalistic
- both casual and serious

## My current wardrobe

My wardrobe is minimalistic.

### Upper body
- shirts and t-shirts:
	- 3 shirts (plain white, soft yellow and checkered red-blue)
	- 3 t-shirts (plain yellow with logo, plain white with design, grey with design)
	- 1 long-sleeve t-shirt (plain dark green)
	- 2 sport t-shirts (pe√±arol, black thermal nike) 
- cold
	- 1 woolen sweater (dark grey)
	- 2 sport sweaters (plain light grey, turquoise with grey)
	- 1 polar jacket (columbia grey)
	- 1 raincoat (columbia green)

### Lower body
- socks (cotton, short/long, white/black)
- boxers (black/grey/white/blue, cotton stretch)
- 1 jean (blue levis) 
- 1 sport short (grey)
- 1 pair of running shoes (grey)
- 1 pair of flip-flops

As you can see, I have white/gray/black clothes and sometimes green/yellow. Those are the colors that I like. I also lack winter clothing.

What's my first thought? My first order approximation to the things I need to have?

Intuitively I would like some dark (black) boots that are warm and appropiate to go out dancing.


ice colours + sand/black/white
green / white for eyes
horizontal stripes for width
dark blue / black jeans
something chic to pump everything up
