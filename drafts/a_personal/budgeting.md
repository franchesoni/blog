# Budgeting

Start from first principles, what is essential? what is not? Where is most of the money going?

We have expectations, we are used to things. Reducing our lifestyle spending is hard. Take it as a challenge.

Why do I want money? For me:

- survival: shelter, eating, moving around.
- enjoying life, i.e. feeling stuff, traveling, art, friends, music. Food? not so much. Drinks? not much. Going out with girls? hell yes!
- feeling safe: health insurance, mental health, retirement
- power: helping the world, creating cool stuff
- infrastructure: phone contract, google storage, laptops, etc.
- convenience: taking a taxi, saving time, moving closer to the workplace
- lifestyle: having new cool things, showing off. Doesn't matter that much

I'm making 1.4k EUR a month. It's not much. But let's set **priorities and minimums**: 
- 450 = shelter. It is really really hard to find something for less. Travel where I have friends to host me.
- 300 = eating. This is 10 eur a day for meals, which is not much. 3 crous meals, which are ok, are 9.90, and they involve subsidies I don't even have the right to get!
- 140 = donations. I need to help the world to feel my life is meaningful. This is a very direct way to do it. I feel morally superior and wash my SLB cifre. I am currently donating 200+ a month with delays.
- 100 = travel. I love to do this.
- 90 = mental health. 3 sessions a month at 30 each.
- 50 = moving around. I bought a nice cheap bike (280 eur) and free pass paris transportation (350 with 50% subsidy from my employer). Sum mistakes, trottinetes and accesories and you get to 50 per month.
- 33 = health insurance. I took one with lots of things because I like to feel safe.
- 20 = infrastructure. I don't really know what laptops cost, as I bought mine in mid 2019 at 500 usd, so it's like 13 per month + phone + google. 
- 20 = lifestyle. I don't know what to put here. Most showing off goes through social networks.
- ? = convenience. Difficult to measure, as it translates to time-saving. Put a price tag on my hour and we'll see.
- ? = going out. To be determined. 
- ? = investments. For my retirement and gathering power. Also called savings.

Total = 1203
It is reasonable that with minimums and these priorities I can't get to save a lot. Last month was my first on red numbers. That's why I'm doing this. I need a way out. I need a dark green forest. To do this, I have to cut on stuff.

measures:
- respect the fasting regime. Eat at crous or cheap places. Do not spend more than 10 a day eating.
- reduce donations to 140 a month. In any case, tax deductions will be helping here.
- go for meaningful refunds if the time is worth it.
- don't exceed 3 sessions a month of coaching / therapy
- reduce lifestyle to 0. Don't buy stuff. You already have solved this issue.
- try to buy only meaningful activities that you can't get free. Do not buy drinks unless a great girl requires you to.

REMEMBER THAT TIME IS THE MOST VALUABLE
