<h1 id="the-future-is-exciting">The future is exciting</h1>
<p>There are good reasons to believe everything will go very badly (see “Principles for dealing with the changing world order - Ray Dalio” and “Collapsology - Wikipedia”). However, there are also good reasons to believe the future will be bright and will bring abundance. As I was doing a literature review on computer vision I got more and more excited about the awesome research being done. I wanted and needed to share this optimistic view, so here it is.</p>
<h2 id="ai-is-doing-and-will-continue-to-do-great">AI is doing and will continue to do great</h2>
<h3 id="the-computer-vision-case">The computer vision case</h3>
<p>Computer vision aims to make machines understand, process, and extract useful information from visual data. Visual data are images (in many formats), but also video or point clouds (from lidar). It can be captured by smartphones, satellites, drones, security cameras, webcams, robots, cars, etc. The amount of information is huge and is shared through the internet.</p>
<p>Originally restricted to image processing and hard-coded algorithms, computer vision now solves problems that were out of reach a decade ago. The computing power available and artificial neural networks are the basis of these advances, but there is a great deal of research that is creating the advances. Today, most problems involving images and simple information extraction can be solved given a large enough high-quality dataset. In my lab, people call this “dumb deep learning” and we know it works. Researchers move on and companies do most dumb deep learning now.</p>
<p>What are researchers moving on to?</p>
<ul>
<li>learn useful visual representations (that make “dumb deep learning” way easier) from unlabeled data</li>
<li>get better estimates of everything, especially 3D vector fields from video, with and without unlabeled data</li>
<li>make video predictions</li>
<li>mix images and other data (text, audio, …)</li>
<li>synthesize or reconstruct images, video, and 3D objects</li>
<li>make networks more efficient and deal with larger networks and datasets</li>
<li>make networks work out-of-distribution and/or with very little supervision (my PhD topic)</li>
<li>annotate data more efficiently (my PhD topic)</li>
<li>applications (develop particular solutions for X problem) (e.g. my students’ work: video prediction = satellite cloudiness forecasting)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are only some of the exciting research directions, there are others I don’t know. It won’t be far in the future that we’ll have computers that can understand the movements and existence of objects in scenes as well as animals do (I have been fighting with pigeons in my window, they are surprisingly smart). They will be able to do video predictions and generate beautiful images and videos, from text or out of nowhere. We will be able to extract way more information than we currently do.</p>
<h3 id="other-ai-areas">Other AI areas</h3>
<p>Of course, computer vision is only one part of AI. Natural language processing (NLP) deals with human language, and impressive results are being obtained. AI that writes for us is already here and will be made more and more available in the future. Audio and speech processing will enable almost real-time very accurate translation. AI that writes for us can already write code and does great on coding challenges. I use one to code that is called “Copilot”, and I feel like it reads my mind and sometimes inspires it (by providing pieces of code I did not know how to write). Another exciting area is Reinforcement Learning (RL), where entities called “agents” learn to interact with an environment in a way that accumulates the greatest sum of rewards possible. This is very similar to how animals learn and provides a glimpse of super-human AI that can “reason” and “experiment” (although not that much). The symbolic AI community, which was the popular one before deep learning, is now working in causal inference, which is a framework to process data according to world models and get causality insights (deprecating the “correlation is not causation” phrase). All the intersections between these areas are also very vivid, and text is being used to tell neural networks what to look for, how to act, and what to explain.</p>
<h3 id="impact-of-ai-in-non-ai-areas">Impact of AI in non-AI areas</h3>
<p>The crazy and marvelous thing about AI is that it is fundamentally about information technology. I read in a book that the three pillars of everything are matter, energy, and information. Well, AI tackles the information one, which is the one where human intelligence plays and imagines, later making advances in the other two pillars.</p>
<h4 id="it">IT</h4>
<p>Imagine a world in which information access is widespread and processing is easy. Traffic lights that know when to change and coordinate mobility. An operating system that knows what you want to do and helps you do it faster. Faster and better document summarization. These things can already exist.</p>
<p>In the limit, all information you need might be available and curated instantly and decisions making systems will be optimal and operate with complete information. This limit case would be huge and, although is unattainable, and we are getting closer very fast.</p>
<h3 id="other-areas">Other areas</h3>
<p>These are just a handful, but let’s look at some areas where AI is already having a high impact. AI is as inevitable as computers themselves. At some point, it stops being AI and becomes part of the discipline. Very summarized and missing components: - materials science: AI has already written a paper and proposed materials that when investigated were found to have very good properties - chemistry: automation of experiments and simulations are being used more and more, accelerating research - history: documents are being restored, processed and their information digitalized. Friendly visualizations and ways to explore many data are in use - energy: AI is not only helping advance nuclear fusion but also making “the smart grid” a reality. More efficient scheduling and energy dispatch are to be expected. A future with batteries and pannels everywhere is a synonym with AI. - drug discovery: companies are using AI to explore and find new drugs - robotics: not only self-driving vehicles (tractors, drones, trains already work and cars are on their way) but also humanoid robots will carry AI and help us solve a greater variety of problems. Think about your washer. Version 2 will be a robot cleaning your home or cooking for you. - finance: the best market-neutral hedge fund is worse than the AI-powered numerai (for whom I “work”). Again, more data/AI = better decision-making. - health: drug discovery is related, but the capacity of computers to process huge amounts of data and establish statistical or causal relationships is way greater than that of humans. Predict diseases before they occur and have an AI doctor help diagnose and personalize all human health data to your case. Longevity will increase - weather: as in “back to the future” was promised, we will have better and better forecasts. In these last years, the NOAA started implementing its AI strategy plan. They have a lot of data. - recommendation: this is an area that is grabbing tons of money because it is behind advertising. But imagine all the things you could do better if you just had better recommendations. That would be cool - human-computer interaction: an operating system that knows what you are going to do next, or one you tell it what to do and how to do it and follows your orders. Interpret your brain signals and more. - electronics: chip design is already being tackled using RL strategies - education: self-paced learning with custom curricula is something enabled by AI - science: theorem proving, article lookup, etc.</p>
<h4 id="synergies">Synergies</h4>
<p>If you are following the pattern here, data + AI = better information processing. Taking health, knowing more accurate probabilities of having heart disease might be life-or-death. However, there are feedback loops in most everything. Health advances bring longer lifespans, so researchers can keep diving into AI (my supervisor is almost 70 and he is as sharp as one can be). Finance will provide (presumably) better resource allocation, this is AI choosing whether to put money into AI (but considering other investments). Human-computer interaction means more data, which helps AI. Electronics enable AI and AI pushes advances in electronics. Education is made better by AI and educated people make AI better. AI also improves science making, which in turn builds AI. Lastly, and more excitingly, AI can code. I don’t think it will be too long (a few decades) until we get an AI that codes itself (this is what OpenAI is aiming to do) and can prove theorems better than humans. The awesome thing about these synergies is that they take us closer to a singularity moment.</p>
<h3 id="unstoppability-of-ai">Unstoppability of AI</h3>
<p>Because of how powerful AI is at enabling productivity increases, it will continue to receive much funding and attention. The AI community has exploited an abundance coming from ads money (funding google brain, facebook AI research, deepmind) and is now at the point in which it is really generating value for other disciplines. There are some reasons why research in AI could be slowed (existential fears or AI winter), but they won’t matter. AI is being built by engineers and scientists and it allows engineers and scientists to optimize their work. They will continue to do so. The big AI trunk will be in the middle and many branches of research on applications will depart from it. The tree will grow.</p>
<h2 id="ai-in-the-bigger-picture">AI in the bigger picture</h2>
<p>Information, energy, and matter. Fire, crops, hydraulics, steel, writing… fast forward to smartphones. Most of these were intelligence unlocking progress, and some were intelligence unlocking intelligence (writing, printing press, computers, internet). AI is just an extension of this line. However, there is a bigger picture. Information, energy, and matter are only one part of humanity. We also have emotions. Emotion drives us to play games, be parents, and adopt political views. Historically, society and technology, material and cultural foundations, politics and science, had been the most important determinants of mostly everything, alongside some non-trivial environmental influence. I won’t delve into politics because I can’t give objective opinions, I just want to say that the impact of tech depends heavily on how tech is used. Also, the impact of tech is limited many times for political reasons (see “Why nations fail”). For instance, the involvement of AI in health is largely dependent on doctors’ adoption of the systems and privacy considerations regarding data sharing. It has always been the case that some improvements (in global terms) were very possible and straightforward but were impeded by some groups. What I mean is that tech is most of the time always subjugated to politics, which is only natural.</p>
<p>At the same time, most countries recognize (especially China and the US), that AI is crucial in their development. Most countries will try to push AI forward instead of stopping it because it’s just so important. People recognize that the potential of IT in general and AI in particular is huge. Try to pay attention to what would a world with perfect information and optimal decision-making systems would look like. The speed of the area is crazy. Only in the first quarter of 2022, there was some groundbreaking work. The literature review I did in November is already outdated. I honestly don’t know how people keep up. But we try to :)</p>
<p>Good future</p>
