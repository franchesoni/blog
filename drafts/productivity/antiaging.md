# Age slowing and reversal

There is exciting research on longevity.
Here I lay out a first view of the field for you.

## Philosophy 
For most researchers, longevity means living a longer healthy life or _increasing the healthspan_. 
But there are people that want to go straight for inmortality, Aubrey de Grey as an example (and other researchers commenting on reddit).
I will talk about _increasing the healthspan_, which is equivalent to a number of no-smoking-like policies, This is, longevity = healthier lifestyle.

## Participants
Advances are created by people and organizations. Here I present the most important.

One of the most famous figures is [David Sinclair](https://twitter.com/davidasinclair), a professor at Harvard and founder of many startups in the field. He is capable and has an optimistic view of the future of biology, personalized medicine and aging. He has a brand new podcast "Lifespan", which is quite good. 
However, disclaimers should be provided. David has a very self-promoting way of talking and has also strong [economic interests](https://sinclair.hms.harvard.edu/david-sinclairs-affiliations) behind some of the products he recommends. In fact, most sponsors of his podcast are companies founded by him. This is why I went into [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/longevity/comments/rfbzs5/lifespan_book_review_reasons_fight_aging_thoughts/) and twitter in order to find out how much should I trust David. My conclusion is that the field is not as divided as it may seem at first glance, as most researchers respect and cite each other's work. The contents in his podcast seem up-to-date, integrating papers that are not from his lab. I think most of his work is respectable.


The main discrepancies between David and others are
1. how to measure aging, because of the [skepticism over biological age test](https://twitter.com/mkaeberlein/status/1474408790367686656) and [lack of evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34543398/)how to measure aging
2. whether Resveratrol is really helpful or not.
3. wether there is such a thing as longevity genes to be regulated, better described [in this video](https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1YqJDqMgkWQxV).


Other well known researchers in this field or related are Shinya Yamanaka (nobel prize because of stem cell research) that keeps producing [promising research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590920304604), Matt Kaeberlein, Jean Hebert, [Morgan Levine](https://www.wired.com/video/watch/tech-support-biology-professor-answers-aging-questions-from-twitter), Michael Levin, Dudley Lamming, or influencers like Kevin Bass or Aubrey de Grey (sorry if put them in the same category).

On the other hand, some billionaires have created their own labs. In particular, Jeff Bezos funded [Altos Lab](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/04/1034364/altos-labs-silicon-valleys-jeff-bezos-milner-bet-living-forever/) and Alphabet's [Calico Labs](https://www.lifespan.io/news/calico-scientists-develop-safer-cellular-reprogramming/).

A bunch of participants associated with some promising technologies being tested are in this [list of rejuvenation policies](https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/).

## Lifespan podcast

### Main content
The main messages of lifespan podcast are:
- a state of perceived adversity promotes longevity. Perceived adversity activate survival circuits that makes us live longer.
- dietary-wise, eating less often, avoiding sugar, avoiding meat, and consuming plant-based meals is great for longevity.
- serious exercise is great for longevity.

- Other details include
    - it is good to exercise until no breath and high bpm. 75 minutes per week minimum. Sex almost doesn't count
    - avoiding iron, as high levels of iron are related to accelerated aging. Iron is related to free radicals and senescent cells.
    - avoiding sugar spikes (white rice causes so for David), using artificial sweeteners, eating sweet at the end, avoiding fructose also, etc. 
    - plant-based, mediterranean, vegetarian, closer to raw, leafy greens - diets are recommended.

## Other sources
- experiments in mice do not always generalize to humans and low glucose is a good thing. [(reference)](https://sci-hub.ee/10.1016/j.cmet.2021.08.013). This low-glucose idea is also present in the podcast.
- dietary advice is [not to be followed blindly](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe7365)
