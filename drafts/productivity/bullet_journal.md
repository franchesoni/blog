# Bullet journal

I think the idea is great and I could be greatly benefited by it. However, I lack a tool. I would use a real life notebook but why if I lose it? And I can not write with a keyboard, which is a dealbreaker. Moreover, I have no automatic backup!

How could I solve this problems? For a real life bullet journal I can just take it with me like my phone, if I lose it I can start it again (indeed, it could be good), and that's about it. But I always have to carry a pencil and eventually transfer it to digital. So why don't I use this on the computer?

I'm quite comfortable with my computer. I just have to make an script. Well, look in GitHub for some initial version.
