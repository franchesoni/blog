Just finished listening to Magatte Wade. Not that long ago I listened to Steve Keen. I am in the US, I have a house, a car, and food, all payed for me. The last woman I slept with was a rich parisian who has enjoyed almost all privileges known to humans and shared some with me. 

What I listened to raises questions. Magette has some powerful points, from which I extracted the following conclusions:
- there are people still suffering quite a lot in this world, and we ought to do something
- the key is letting people achieve their full potential
- what she calls "free markets" are one powerful solution 

Now, from Steve Keen I have concluded that:
- according to him, Marx did not take into account robots / machines as he should
- credit is the fuel of economy, in the sense that when a bank gives a loan, it adds money in the creditor's account and it adds money as a debt to be paid in its balance sheet, i.e. it _creates_ money

What a correct world or alternative could look like is a question I have open, however, I am getting closer. I'll give a list of guiding questions.

- what should we give to a human being in order to allow her to achieve her full potential? (during his whole life)
- do free markets degenerate? i.e. do they have undesirable properties? when? how?
- what are laws? what is their function? how they could be different?
- what is the objective behind the organization of a society?
- how can we ensure that a society progresses?

A society is a set of human beings. It can be large, e.g. global scale, or local, e.g. a neighborhood. A human beings interact with their environment and with each other. They interact following their "nature", i.e. whatever regulates human actions, e.g. culture, hormones, etc. There are some material things that humans tend to desire, e.g. food and shelter/clothing, and some inmaterial, e.g. sex, fun, absense of suffering.

From the human nature, i.e. from the way humans interact with each other and their environment, an order or outcome is produced. If this outcome is caothic, i.e. if it changes a lot by changing a little the initial conditions, we don't know. It is in human nature (because it's seen in many different societies) to form groups. In these groups humans play different roles, which can be exchangeable, temporary and overlapping. We say "roles" to refer to both some activities someone does, e.g. caregiving, and also some other ordering provided by language. It is in human nature to have a language and the language is used to refer to different concepts, between them, roles, e.g. "parents" or "sibling". 

We then have groups of humans who have roles and also individual human interests. These interests are defended by the different humans. The individual interests are not completely selfish, but usually include some collective interest too, e.g. wellbeing of friends. What collective is the most important determines whether different groups would fight between them or not. Fightning is a negative-net sum, but it might provide the winner with a positive outcome when interests are opposed. 

Probably because it is in the interest of everyone, it is also in human nature to try to organize the interaction and the roles. Organizing implies creating explicit expectations for each individual behavior. The expectations might contradict the individual interests. Usually the expectations are enforced: there are consequences carried by not satisfying expectations.

At the same time, the humans must interact with the environment and between them to satisfy their interests. In a traditional society, people use labor to transform nature in a way that is useful to satisfy their needs. "Useful labor" can imply using tools and/or creating tools. But there is also a part of the time that is not used for labor, but for fun or survival.
