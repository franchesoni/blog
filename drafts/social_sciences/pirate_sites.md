# Why piracy is good for information

I am downloading a book on libgen. It costs 22 dollars on Amazon. I am happy this website exists. In fact, I'm also happy sci-hub exists. It makes my life so easy, and my research so much better.

I imagined a future in which libgen was banned, just like Sci-hub was. Well, I don't know if it's banned, maybe I just had a hard time accesing it lately. In this future there are, of course, arguments against piracy. Some of them would go like this:

## Arguments against privacy

Privacy is clearly a robbery. It is going against the private property principle, which has undoubtedly provided our civilization with great progress and comfort. 

Moreover, with piracy having a place, intellectual creators can not be rewarded and thus creative productivity slows down. Who would provide good quality books for free?

## My arguments

Well, one of those people is the author of the book I started to read. He has an estimated worth (sorry) of 20 billion dollars. He is clearly not incentivized by the money he can make out of the book. Which writer is? Of course, there are some of them that try to make a living as writers, but I think those people are already priviledged.

Unpriviledged people are those that can not buy books, those that have no academic institution behind to provide free access to papers. What should they do? Get a friend that is priviledged. That's a priviledge too. Money or contacts.

Privacy exists because it is the only way some people can access good quality information. I am not the one to discuss the academic journal malevolent economy, it has been harshly critiziced elsewhere. I'm just here to say that piracy is more about democratization of knowledge than about robbery, and that intellectual private property is more about preservation of priviledges than about moving the economy forward.

Long live piracy!
