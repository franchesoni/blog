I have been discussing this lately.

# Separating problems
Firstly, we may want to separate contamination (in general) with greenhouse gases emission (which is a particular form of contamination).

# Global warming
## Importance
Global warming is mainly related to the latter. Global warming has been studied and is expected to be _very_ damaging for our physical and economic environment. Thus, as we will have a huge cost to pay in the future if we don't reduce the phenomenon, addressing this problem now is a wise investment.

## Seen as an investment
We can think about this as an investment because reduced future cost is exactly the same as future gain. It's likely we are far away from the investment size needed to prevent many of the costly problems of the future. In other words, it's likely we still have a great expected return on our investment and it makes sense to put more money into it.

## How much is too much?
However, one of the biggest criticisms I have (probably because of my lack of research) is that I don't know the return on investment nor when it is saturated (because it's very likely that there is a diminishing return on investment as the investment size grows). So, how much investment is too much? I am confident we are still enjoying a great RoI and we should exploit this investment opportunity.

## Total emissions
We care about humanely produced gases because without us the environment was quite stable. Greenhouse gases can be computed as:

(produced emissions) = (number of people) x (average per capita consumption) x (emissions per unity)

If we want to take this to zero (and we really should) we want to make at least one of those zero. The one that we can get to zero without significantly reducing quantity or quality of life is **emissions per unity**.

This is true when using the above formula. We can also get one more general one,which is 

(total emissions) = (produced emissions) - (captured emissions)

These two formulas imply different things. If we consider the first one, then we should be obsessed with technology innovation, as it is the only thing that can take us to zero. It won't matter much _with respect to the zero emissions objective_ how many we are or how much we consume. 

However, when considering the second one, we have some slack. We could instead be obsessed with developing carbon capture technologies and also focus on reducing the number of people, the consumption, and the emissions per unit. It's much more to tackle, but it's easier, as there are low hanging fruits in all of these areas.

## Non-binary objective
This is with respect to _zero greenhouse gasses emission_. But reality is non-binary and a reduced percentage now also counts as an investment. So, although it makes sense in the long run to focus more on _tech_ (both carbon capture and reducing the cost of zero emissions production), the future is also heavily conditioned on how many we are and how much we consume.


# Contamination
The same rationale could be applied to contamination in general. But there are a lot of other types, so the problem is multiplied. Furthermore, it's also culture dependent. I have recently found that the concept of "light pollution" exists. Is something I have never cared about. And I'm sure there are other types we are ignoring, like electromagnetic waves, that today we see as clean (I definitely see them as clean) but for some people today and maybe for people in the future they are very polluting.

## We can not escape it
My view here is that we have to be pragmatic. It was easy to have such a negligible impact when the population was very low. But now we are a lot and we can not expect to have zero effect on our environment. There will be for sure some production and some generation of disposable stuff, materials, substances, waves, etc. Without it "modern society" could not exist (at least I'm not that imaginative).

## Sustainability
On the other hand, even if we can not escape contamination, that doesn't mean we can not be sustainable. That would be one beautiful objective, finding a way in which we can live and take part of the environment in a stable way: contamination at a controlled level and without changing the environment. The idea is to compensate for any relevant pollution or make it negligible with respect to its effect on the environment. One example is to throw trash into space. I don't really care, would that be contamination? Another is carbon capture: if we have enough, we can pollute the air, as it will be compensated by tech. This is yet to be developed and we should not expect it to magically appear without serious investment. 

## Ambiguity on the objectives
Another problem is that we should define what is valuable and what is not. Biodiversity is often cited as something we should preserve. But why? I wouldn't mind a world exactly as it is but without mosquitos. I don't miss dinosaurs either, and extinction is natural (I fear me after that phrase). Of course, the extinction of a species is a very explicit absence that indirectly measures how much we are disrupting or changing our environment, which is contrary to the definition of sustainability. Moreover, there could be great unexploded value on the leafs of biological evolution (each of the different species). Human civilization has long been inspired by different animals, it's good to have a wide album.

# Relative cost
So far I have been discussing this topic as a standalone topic. Without comparing it with other problems we humans have. It makes sense for a lefty to care about sustainability because it is likely it will increase inequality, poverty and conflicts, things one would not want. However, from an economic perspective the RoI should be compared to other RoIs, and that idea could easily be extended to a "social RoI". It may be the case that we have no better social investment to make as humans, but I can't help but feel sad about all the people we are not putting money into. Spatial exploration is awesome when persisting human civilization is one of your biggest concerns.
