Donating gives more meaning to me saving money. Although it doesn't feel necessarily nice when I donate I do feel intensely nice when I say that I donate. This is because I think that (i) donating is good and (ii) if there's anything I would breg about is me donating money: I'm happy if someone does more than me.


I'm looking for a place to donate money to. But it seems that the poorest aren't that poor or that the interventions aren't that important. As long as there are people that need to sleep less than what they would like to in order to survive, I think that there's room for helping them. My view is not maximizing years of life but reducing suffering instead. And sleep depravation is suffering.

The issue is that direct cash transfers don't necessarily generate more income in the future. I'm sure they are better than nothing, but what I don't know is whether they're the best we can do.

It's an extremely hard question. On the one hand it makes sense to give money to poor people. On the other hand it also makes sense to care about their future economics. Because even if we reduce suffering, their ability to create value for themselves in the future is important. It's important because they need to produce more to have better lifes. The main issue is that money doesn't really measure effort, production or value.

So we have three main classes of charities: 
i) those that are related to health, which make lives less shitty by saving lives or preventing horrible diseases.
ii) the conditional cash transfer programs, that are cash transfers with a twist that is supposed to generate positive value. The condition can be on something the recepient should do after the program or a characteristic of the recepient (e.g. a farmer).
iii) the unconditional cash transfer programs, that are philosophically the most compelling but also very hard to test and whose effectiveness should be evaluated.

Wether to prefer health donations vs. cash transfers is a question I don't know how to approach, but I incline for cash transfers, probably because I haven't had health issues but I did had money issues. And between unconditional and conditional cash transfer the main question is how much I believe I'm more knowledgeable than the recipients, and how much I believe in the transparency and efficacy (aka non-corruption) of the transfer process.

Because I can put some money in each a question comes to mind: how much? How much to each? Maybe start with 1000 would be cool. I just had an idea: transfer money to people that can get tax exceptions and share the money. That could be huge. Is that illegal?
